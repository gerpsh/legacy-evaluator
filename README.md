# Harvest 2 Evaluator

A prototype and reference implementation for the evaluator specification.

## Install

This service currently depends on an existing Harvest codebase since it uses Avocacdo's APIs directly. The easiest way to setup the service is by running it within the same environment as the Harvest app.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=path.to.settings python service.py
```
